# Isaiah Montoya

## Welcome to My GitHub! 👋

Hello! I'm Isaiah, a Data Scientist with a diverse background and broad set of domain knowledge. I have 3+ years experience working in business intelligence, blended with a Summa Cum Laude degree in English Creative Writing from Arizona State University, enabling me to effectively communicate technical solutions to people of tech and non-tech backgrounds.  

I am currently leveling up my technical skills in a big way through TripleTen's 8 month Data Science program. I'm most excited to take on the Machine Learning modules at the back end of the program, as this is something I have had interest in for years. I am bullish yet practical on AI. With all the major advancements in past year, it became obvious to me that AI will have a tremendous impact on the economy and our day-to-day lives. Does a fully automated economy sound cool to me? Sure, but I'm mostly concerned about staying relevant and empowered to navigate an ever changing world.  

I consider myself a jack of all trades, and am not afraid to jump into areas outside Data Science proper, i.e. software engineering, business strategy development, marketing, and even some mechanical and electrical engineering!

You can check out my completed projects for this program [here](https://github.com/IMMontoya/Data_projects_TripleTen/blob/main/README.md).  
- **Bachelor of Arts in English Creative Writing** from Arizona State University, graduating Summa Cum Laude. My journey through literature has given me a unique perspective on storytelling, critical thinking, and effective communication ✍️.

### Professional Experience 💼

Previously, I worked as a **Data Specialist** at StrataTech Education Group, where I honed my expertise in ad hoc reporting, data analysis, and ETL procedures to uncover key insights that informed strategic decisions. In this role, I showcased my ability to manage complex datasets, utilize analytical tools effectively, and collaborate across departments to drive data-driven improvements in marketing strategies and operational processes.

Before StrataTech, I served in the Finance Department at Art Solutions as an **Accounts Manager**, where I utilized QuickBooks and developed a Google Sheets tool to enhance financial data management and streamline operations. My work involved analyzing financial transactions, reconciling accounts, and applying my analytical skills to develop a customized solution that significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of prorated storage costs calculations.

These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, preparing me for a successful career in data science and analytics.

### Broad-Based Expertise and Interests 🌈

My professional toolkit extends beyond data science, encompassing a wide array of additional skills and passions that enhance my analytical capabilities and contribute to a holistic approach to problem-solving:

- **Music and Audio**: As a trained musician and recording engineer, I possess a nuanced understanding of sound, complementing data projects that involve audio analysis or require innovative auditory data abstractions 🎵.
- **Creativity and Artistry**: My endeavors as a musical artist, alongside my experience in poetry and fiction writing, enrich my ability to craft engaging narratives and visualize data in ways that resonate on a human level 🖌️.
- **Microcontroller Programming**: My self-taught expertise in microcontroller programming allows me to tackle projects involving automation and robotics with a hands-on, practical approach to creating solutions 🤖.
- **Politics, Economics, and Finance**: My interest in these areas fuels my ability to dissect complex datasets, ensuring my analyses are informed by a deep understanding of the broader socio-economic and political contexts 🌍.

This blend of technical proficiency and diverse interests not only amplifies my data science skill set but also makes me a versatile team member capable of crossing traditional boundaries to drive innovation. My broad knowledge base enables me to contribute uniquely to projects, particularly those at the intersection of technology and critical global issues, positioning me as a valuable asset to teams looking for dynamic and insightful expertise.

### Currently Seeking New Opportunities 🚀

I am actively searching for new roles that allow me to leverage my data science and analysis skills to make a meaningful impact. My interests are broad yet I am deeply focused on the details. Specifically, I'm passionate about contributing to projects related to **politics, climate, sustainability, robotics, and automation**.

What sets me apart is not just my technical expertise in data science but also my wide breadth of knowledge across various domains. This interdisciplinary understanding enables me to approach problems from unique perspectives, fostering innovative solutions that are both effective and sustainable. I believe that my diverse background not only enhances my ability to analyze and interpret data but also makes me a valuable asset to teams working at the cutting edge of their fields.
